To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress already installed. For information in regard to
installing the WordPress platform, please read this :ref:`article <reference-newwp>`.

When you are ready to install a theme, you must first upload the theme files and then activate the theme itself.
To upload a theme, use one of the following methods:

- Via Dashboard: Navigate to **Appearance > Themes**, click at button **Add new** , then click on **Browse**. Choose file *"realtypace.zip"* and next > **Install Now**.

- Via FTP: Using your FTP client, upload the non-zipped theme folder into the */wp-content/themes/* folder on your server.
  Once the theme is uploaded, you need to activate it. Go to **Appearance > Themes** and activate your chosen theme.


Required plugin installation
----------------------------

In order to take the most advantage from our theme, we recommend installing both required and recommended plugins.

Once you activate the theme, you will see a notice in the top part where the installation wizard will suggest
installing the plugins. To proceed, click **Begin installing plugins**. After installation, go to plugins page,
select all the plugins and **activate** them.



Import demo data
----------------

Once all required plugins has been installed, you can go to **Appearance > Import Demo Data** and
click on the button **Import data**.
This wizard will automatically import demo data to your site and configure your WordPress installation
to look like our demo site.
