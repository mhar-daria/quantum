Editing layout
++++++++++++++

Open one of the agent's page details, go to **Customize / Current page options / Layout**


.. image:: ../img/start-customize.png

.. image:: ../img/customize-current.png


Here you will find options:

* **Title**
* **Subtitle**
* **Panel**
* **Sidebar position**
    - As defined in Layout
    - Left
    - Right
    - None

* **Property display mode**
    - List
    - Grid
* **Property grid size**
    - Small
    - Medium
    - Large
* **Properties per page**
* **Show agent contact form**
* **Contact Form 7**



.. tip::
    Add one space in title or subtitle field to remove at all text from frontend. Remove default text from panel editor, will hide a green panel!

Agent contact form
++++++++++++++++++

We recommend to use demo form "Agent post form". In settings for this form in "Mail" tab paste in field "To" ``[_agent_email]`` shortcode.

In this case mail will be sent to required agent.

If you don't need listing information on agent listings, you can hide it with css:

.. code-block:: css

    .worker__item .worker__listings {
      display: none;
    }
