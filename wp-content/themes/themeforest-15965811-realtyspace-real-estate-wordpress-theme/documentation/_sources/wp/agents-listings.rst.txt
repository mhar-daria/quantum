Here you will find options:

* Sidebar position
    - As defined in Layout
    - Left
    - Right
    - None

* **Display mode**
    - List
    - Grid
* **Items per page** - change number of items (agents) to be displayed on a page.

Add one space in title or subtitle field to remove at all text from frontend. Remove default text from panel editor, will hide a green panel!
